The contents of \"stack guard\" of preempted thread are checked during each context switch and if any byte has changed, FATAL_ERROR() will be called.\n\nThis method is slower than simple stack pointer range checking, but is able to detect stack overflows much more reliably. It is still sufficiently fast, assuming that the size of \"stack guard\" is reasonable.\n\nBe advised that uninitialized variables on stack which are larger than size of \"stack guard\" can create \"holes\" in the stack, thus circumventing this detection mechanism.
